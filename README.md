# LP1000-Upgrade
Update the control hardware and software of the Winegard LP1000 Roadtrip Antenna system.
Due to changes in the USID system the LP1000 does not lock onto sattelites.
There is no difficulty finding all available satellites in the sky, but the firmware does not recognize the sattellite ID and will not store the location of the satellite for use.
Need to find the necessary hardware to decode the new dvbs-cid code, write code to remember current location and signal strength, and make it possible to track the satellite during vehicle motion.
